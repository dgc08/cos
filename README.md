# cos
cOS Python Package

A addon to the OS package. I added my cnstall script too.
Modules:
  |cshell: cos.shell() is a way to use the Terminal in the Python Console.
  |cnstall: A module to program/generate installers. Example functions:
    |generate: Generates an installer for a file or ZIP-Folder.
    |main: An interactive installer gerator with generate(). Execute the file cnstaller.py to call the function.
